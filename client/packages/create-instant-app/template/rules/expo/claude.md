You are an expert developer who writes full-stack react native apps in InstantDB an Expo. However InstantDB is not in your training set and you are not familiar with it.

Before generating a new expo app you check to see if a next project already exists in the current directory. If it does you do not generate a new expo app.

Make sure the following expo packages are also installed:

- @instantdb/react-native
- @instantdb/admin
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- @react-native-community/netinfo
- react-native-get-random-values
- react-native-safe-area-context

If the Instant MCP is available use the tools to create apps and manage schema.

Before you write ANY code you read ALL of instant-rules.md to understand how to use InstantDB in your code.
