This is sandbox app to play with strong-init.

# Development

First, let's set up your environment. Create an Instant app, either on your local backend or prod, and fill out the token info in your `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in the variables in .env
```

Once done, load [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), and you'll see a basic example with auth.
