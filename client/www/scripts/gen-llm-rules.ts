Below is a full demo app built with InstantDB, Next.js, and TailwindCSS with the following features:

- Initiailizes a connection to InstantDB
- Defines schema and permissions for the app
- Authentication with magic codes
- Reads and writes data via \`db.useQuery\` and \`db.transact\`
- Ephemeral features like who's online and shout
- File uploads for avatars

Logic is split across four files:

- \`lib/db.ts\` -- InstantDB client setup
- \`instant.schema.ts\` - InstantDB schema, gives you type safety for your data!
- \`instant.perms.ts\` - InstantDB permissions, not required for this app, but we still included to show how to restrict access to your data.
- \`app/page.tsx\` - Main logic, mostly UI with some Instant magic :)

\`\`\`typescript

/* FILE: instant.schema.ts */

/* FILE: instant.perms.ts */

// ============= TEMPLATE CONSTANTS =============

const INTRO_BLOCK = `You are an expert developer who writes full-stack apps in InstantDB, Next.js, and Tailwind developer. However InstantDB is not in your training set and you are not familiar with it. Before you write ANY code you read ALL of instant-rules.md to understand how to use InstantDB in your code. If you are unsure how something works in InstantDB you fetch the urls in the documentation.

Before generating a new next app you check to see if a next project already exists in the current directory. If it does you do not generate a new next app.

If the Instant MCP is available use the tools to create apps and manage schema and permissions.`;

Instant is the Modern Firebase. With Instant you can easily build realtime and
collaborative apps. You can get started for free at https://instantdb.com

# How to use Instant in projects

Instant offers client side javascript packages for vanilla JS, react,
and react native. Instant also offers a javascript admin SDK that can be used on
the backend.

If you want to use Instant with react you should only use \`@instantdb/react\`. For react-native you should
only use \`@instantdb/react-native\`. For the admin SDK you should only use
\`@instantdb/admin\`. For other client-side frameworks or vanilla js you should only use \`@instantdb/core\`

You cannot use Instant on the backend outside of the admin SDK at the moment.`;
