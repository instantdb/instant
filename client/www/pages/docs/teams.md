description: How to manage your Instant app's team members and their roles.
---

Apps with a Pro subscription can be managed by multiple users. To add team members to your app, head on over to the [Dashboard Admin tab](https://instantdb.com/dash?s=main&t=admin).

## Roles

App team members can have one of three roles: collaborator, admin or owner.

#### Collaborators

- Can view the Explorer, update Permissions, and configure Auth.

#### Admins

- Can invite other team members.

#### Owners (i.e., an app's creator)

- Can access the Billing tab.
- Can regenerate the app's admin tokens.
- Can delete their app.

## Invites

#### Inviting a team member

A pro app's admin or owner simply needs to navigate to the [Dashboard Admin tab](https://instantdb.com/dash?s=main&t=admin) and click "Invite a team member". This will open a dialog that accepts an email and role. This will send an email with instructions to the specified address.

#### Accepting an invite

Once an invited user signs up for Instant, they can access the [Dashboard Invites section](https://instantdb.com/dash?s=invites) where they can accept or decline the invite.
