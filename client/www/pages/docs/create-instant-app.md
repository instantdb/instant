description: Use create-instant-app to scaffold a new Instant project
---

Once you know the basics of Instant, you may find it useful to be able to
quickly scaffold a new Instant project. We built `create-instant-app` to do just
that.

We currently offer templates for Next.js, Expo, and Vanilla Typescript. Follow the quick start below to give it a spin!

## Quick start

If you haven't already, authenticate with the [Instant CLI](/docs/cli) in your
terminal.

```shell {% showCopy=true %}
npx instant login
```

This will open a browser window where you can log in or sign up for an account.
Once you've authenticated, any app you create with `create-instant-app` will be
associated with your Instant account!

After authenticating you run the following command to scaffold a new Instant app.

```shell {% showCopy=true %}
npx create-instant-app instant-demo
```

Run the dev server to see your new app in action!

```shell
cd instant-demo
npm run dev
```

Huzzah! ðŸŽ‰ You now have a brand new Instant project to play around with!

## One-shot with Claude Code

Got Claude Code? You can use it to one-shot a full-stack Instant app!

Use `create-instant-app` with the `--ai` flag and you'll be prompted to describe the app you want to build. Give it a try!

{% tabbed-single tabs={
  "npx": { "label": "npx", "content": "npx create-instant-app --ai" },
  "pnpx": { "label": "pnpx", "content": "pnpx create-instant-app --ai" },
  "bunx": { "label": "bunx", "content": "bunx create-instant-app --ai" }
} defaultTab="npx" storageKey="pkg-manager" /%}

You can think of this as a one-shot app builder in the terminal.

Right now this only works with Next.js and Expo. We're keen to improve this feature so if you have any
feedback please let us know below or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VU53p7uQcE)!
