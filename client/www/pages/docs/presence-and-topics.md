title: Presence, Cursors, and Activity
---

Sometimes you want to show real-time updates to users without persisting the
data to your database. Common scenarios include:

- Shared cursors in a collaborative whiteboard like Figma
- Who's online in a document editor like Google Docs
- Typing indicators in chat apps like Discord
- Live reactions in a video streaming app like Twitch

Instant provides three primitives for quickly building these ephemeral experiences: rooms, presence, and topics.

**Rooms**

A room represents a temporary context for realtime events. Users in the same room will receive updates from every other user in that room.

**Presence**

Presence is an object that each peer shares with every other peer. When a user updates their presence, it's instantly replicated to all users in that room. Presence persists throughout the remainder of a user's connection, and is automatically cleaned up when a user leaves the room

You can use presence to build features like "who's online." Instant's cursor and typing indicator are both built on top of the presence API.

**Topics**

Topics have "fire and forget" semantics, and are better suited for data that don't need any sort of persistence. When a user publishes a topic, a callback is fired for every other user in the room listening for that topic.

You can use topics to build features like "live reactions." The real-time emoji button panel on Instant's homepage is built using the topics API.

**Transact vs. Ephemeral**

You may be thinking when would I use `transact` vs `presence` vs `topics`? Here's a simple breakdown:

- Use `transact` when you need to persist data to the db. For example, when a user sends a message in a chat app.
- Use `presence` when you need to persist data in a room but not to the db. For example, showing
  who's currently viewing a document.
- Use `topics` when you need to broadcast data to a room, but don't need to persist it. For example, sending a live reaction to a video stream.

## Setup

To obtain a room reference, call `db.room(roomType, roomId)`

```typescript
type Schema = {
  user: { name: string };
}

// Provide a room schema to get typings for presence!
type RoomSchema = {
  chat: {
    presence: { name: string };
  };
}

const APP_ID = '__APP_ID__';

// db will export all the presence hooks you need!
const db = init<Schema, RoomSchema>({ appId: APP_ID });

// Specifying a room type and room id gives you the power to
// restrict sharing to a specific room. However you can also just use
// `db.room()` to share presence and topics to an Instant generated default room
const room = db.room('chat', roomId);
```

Types for room schemas are defined as follows:

```typescript
// Generic type for room schemas.
type RoomSchemaShape = {
  [roomType: string]: {
    presence?: { [k: string]: any };
    topics?: {
      [topic: string]: {
        [k: string]: any;
      };
    };
  };
};
```

## Presence
One common use case for presence is to show who's online.

Instant's `usePresence` is similar in feel to `useState`. It returns an object containing the current user's presence state, the presence state of every other user in the room, and a function (`publishPresence`) to update the current user's presence. `publishPresence` is similar to React's `setState`, and will merge the current and new presence objects.

```typescript
type Schema = {
  user: { name: string };
}

type RoomSchema = {
  chat: {
    presence: { name: string };
  };
}

const APP_ID = '__APP_ID__'
const db = init<Schema, RoomSchema>({ appId: APP_ID });

const room = db.room('chat', 'main');
const randomId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 6);
const user = {
  name: `User#${randomId}`,
};

function Component() {
  const { user: myPresence, peers, publishPresence } = room.usePresence();

  // Publish your presence to the room
  useEffect(() => {
    publishPresence({ name: user.name });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Who's online?</h1>
      <p>You are: {myPresence.name}</p>
      <h2>Others:</h2>
      <ul>
      {/* Loop through all peers and render their names. Peers will have the
          same properties as what you publish to the room. In this case, `name`
          is the only property we're publishing. Use RoomSchema to get type
          safety for your presence object.
      */}
        {Object.entries(peers).map(([peerId, peer]) => (
          <li key={peerId}>{peer.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

`usePresence` accepts a second parameter to select specific slices of user's presence object.

```typescript
const room = db.room('chat', 'chatRoomId');
// will only return the `status` value for each peer
// will only trigger an update when a user's `status` value changes (ignoring any other changes to presence).
// This is useful for optimizing re-renders in React.

const { user, peers, publishPresence } = room.usePresence({
  keys: ['status'],
});
```

You may also specify an array of `peers` and a `user` flag to further constrain the output. If you wanted a "write-only" hook, it would look like this:

```typescript
// Will not trigger re-renders on presence changes
const room = db.room('chat', 'chatRoomId');

const { publishPresence } = room.usePresence({
  peers: [],
  user: false,
});
```

## Topics

Instant provides 2 hooks for sending and handling events for a given topic. `usePublishTopic` returns a function you can call to publish an event, and `useTopicEffect` will be called each time a peer in the same room publishes a topic event.

```typescript
type Schema = {
  user: { name: string };
  video: { url: string, title: string };
}

type RoomSchema = {
  video: {
    presence: { name: string };
    topics: {
      reaction: { emoji: string };
    };
  };
}

const APP_ID = '__APP_ID__';
const db = init<Schema, RoomSchema>({ appId: APP_ID });

const room = db.room('video', 'room-id-123');

function Component() {
  const publishEmote = room.usePublishTopic('emotes');

  room.useTopicEffect('emotes', (event, peer) => {
    // Render broadcasted emotes!
    renderEmote(event.emoji);
  });

  return <button onClick={() => publishEmote({ emoji: 'ðŸ”¥' })}>ðŸ”¥</button>;
}
```

## Cursors and Typing Indicators (React only)

We wanted to make adding real-time features to your apps as simple as possible, so we shipped our React library with 2 drop-in utilities: `Cursors` and `useTypingIndicator`.

### Cursors

Adding multiplayer cursors to your app is as simple as importing our `<Cursors>` component!

```typescript
import { Cursors } from '@instantdb/react';

// ...

return (
  <Cursors room={room} currentUserColor="tomato">
    {/* Your app here */}
  </Cursors>
);
```

You can provide a `renderCursor` function to return your own custom cursor component.

```typescript
<Cursors
  room={room}
  className="cursors"
  currentUserColor="papayawhip"
  renderCursor={renderCoolCustomCursor}
/>
```

You can render multiple cursor spaces. For instance, imagine you're building a screen with multiple tabs. You want to only show cursors on the same tab as the current user. You can provide each `<Cursors />` element with their own `spaceId`.

```typescript
<Tabs>
  {tabs.map((tab) => (
    <Tab>
      <Cursors room={room} spaceId={`tab-${tab.id}`} className="tab-cursor">
        {/* ... */}
      </Cursors>
    </Tab>
  ))}
</Tabs>
```

You can even nest `<Cursors />`!

```typescript
<Cursors
  room={room}
  spaceId="space-outer"
  userCursorColor="magenta"
  className="cursors-nested-outer"
>
  <Cursors
    room={room}
    spaceId="space-inner"
    userCursorColor="blue"
    className="cursors-nested-inner"
  />
</Cursors>
```

### Typing indicators

`useTypingIndicator` is a small utility useful for building inputs for chat-style apps. You can use this hook to show
things like "Peer is typing..." in your chat app.

```javascript {% showCopy=true %}
import { init } from '@instantdb/react';

type Schema = {
  user: { name: string };
}

// Provide a room schema to get typings for presence!
type RoomSchema = {
  chat: {
    presence: { name: string };
  };
}

const APP_ID = '__APP_ID__';
const db = init<Schema, RoomSchema>({ appId: APP_ID });

const randomId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 6);
const user = {
  name: `User#${randomId}`,
};

const room = db.room('chat', 'main');

export default function InstantTypingIndicator() {
  // 1. Publish your presence in the room. We only need the `publishPresence` function
  //    so we can ignore `user` and `peers` presence updates.
  const { publishPresence } = room.usePresence({
    peers: [],
    user: false,
  });
  useEffect(() => {
    publishPresence({ name: user.name });
  }, []);

  // 2. Use the typing indicator hook
  const typing = room.useTypingIndicator('chat');

  const onKeyDown = (e) => {
    // 3. Render typing indicator
    typing.inputProps.onKeyDown(e);

    // 4. Optionally run your own onKeyDown logic
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) {
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log('Message sent:', e.target.value);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen gap-3 p-2">
      <div key="main" className="flex flex-1 flex-col justify-end">
        <textarea
          onKeyBlur={typing.inputProps.onBlur}
          onKeyDown={onKeyDown}
          placeholder="Compose your message here..."
          className="w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm"
        />
        <div className="truncate text-xs text-gray-500">
          {typing.active.length ? typingInfo(typing.active) : <>&nbsp;</>}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function typingInfo(users) {
  if (users.length === 0) return null;
  if (users.length === 1) return `${users[0].name} is typing...`;
  if (users.length === 2)
    return `${users[0].name} and ${users[1].name} are typing...`;

  return `${users[0].name} and ${users.length - 1} others are typing...`;
}
```
