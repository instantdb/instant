      <p>Effective Date: March 19, 2024</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Binding Agreement</strong>. This is a binding contract
        (&quot;Terms&quot;) between you and Instant (&quot;we,&quot;
        &quot;us,&quot; &quot;our&quot;, “Instant”). These Terms apply whenever
        you use any of the sites, apps, products, or services
        (&quot;Services&quot;) we offer, in existence now to created in the
        future. Further, we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these
        Terms will apply to such upgrades. By accessing or using the Services,
        you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you use our services on behalf
        of an organization, you agree to these terms on behalf of that
        organization. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy</strong>. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>{' '}
        for details on how we collect, store, and share user information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Age Restrictions</strong>. The Services are not intended for
        users who are under the age of 13. In order to create an account for the
        Services, you must be 13 years of age or older. By registering, you
        represent and warrant that you are 13 years of age or older. If children
        between the ages of 13 and 18 wish to use the Services, they must be
        registered by their parent or guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Your Content and Permissions</strong>. Instant allows you to
        share just about anything--files, videos, links, music, documents, code,
        and text (&quot;Your Content&quot;). Your Content is yours. Instant does
        not claim any right, title, or interest in Your Content. You grant us a
        non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to do the things we need
        to do to provide the Services, including but not limited to storing,
        displaying, reproducing, and distributing Your Content. This license
        extends to trusted third parties we work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Content Guidelines</strong>. You are fully responsible for Your
        Content. You may not copy, upload, download, or share Your Content
        unless you have the appropriate rights to do so. It is your
        responsibility to ensure that Your Content abides by applicable laws,
        and these Terms. We don&#39;t actively review Your Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Account Security</strong>. You are responsible for safeguarding
        your password to the Services, making sure that others don&#39;t have
        access to it, and keeping your account information current. You must
        immediately notify Instant of any unauthorized uses of your account or
        any other breaches of security. Instant will not be liable for your acts
        or omissions, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of
        your acts or omissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Changes to these Terms</strong>. We are constantly updating our
        Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms
        under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are
        material, we will let you know, for example by posting on one of our
        blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the
        changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of
        time after which the new Terms will take effect. If you disagree with
        our changes, then you should stop using Instant within the designated
        notice period. Your continued use of Instant will be subject to the new
        Terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be
        governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration
        clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our Intellectual Property</strong>: The Services and all
        materials contained therein, including, without limitation, Instant
        logo, and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, data,
        software, sound files, other files, and the selection and arrangement
        thereof (collectively, the &quot;Instant Materials&quot;) are the
        property of Instant or its licensors or users and are protected by U.S.
        and international intellectual property laws. You are granted a
        personal, limited, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, revocable license
        to access and use Instant Materials in accordance with these Terms for
        the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection
        with the Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use
        of the Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise
        use any Instant, or third-party trademarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Termination</strong>. You are free to stop using the Services at
        any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at
        any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may
        suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you fail to comply with
        these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal
        liability, disrupt the Services, or disrupt others&#39; use of the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong>. We make no warranties of any
        kind with respect to Instant or your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>. We shall not have any
        liability for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special,
        exemplary, or damages under any theory of liability arising out of, or
        relating to, these Terms or your use of Instant. As a condition of
        access to Instant, you understand and agree that our liability shall not
        exceed $0.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Indemnification</strong>. You will indemnify, defend, and hold
        us, our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, and employees, harmless from
        any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments,
        costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) brought
        by a third party arising out of or in connection with: (i) any act or
        omission by you, in connection with your use of Instant or (ii) your
        breach or alleged breach of any of these Terms. We may, at its option,
        elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of a claim
        subject to indemnification. You agree not to settle any such claim
        without the prior written consent of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>. We both agree to resolve any
        disputes arising out of these Terms or your use of Instant through final
        and binding arbitration. Arbitration is a less formal procedure than a
        lawsuit in court, with the goal of resolving disputes more quickly. We
        both agree to waive our rights to have our claims decided by a judge or
        jury. Instead, the arbitration shall be finally settled in accordance
        with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and
        Mediation Service, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) by three arbitrators
        appointed in accordance with the Rules. The arbitration will be held in
        the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or
        any other location we agree to, and shall be conducted in the English
        language. The arbitrators&#39; decision may be enforced in any court of
        competent jurisdiction. We will not pay arbitration fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>. Claims for
        injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property
        rights may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a
        bond.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No Class Actions</strong>. You may resolve disputes with us only
        on an individual basis; you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a
        class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.{' '}
        <strong>
          Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions,
          and consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Governing Law</strong>. You agree that these Terms, and your use
        of Instant, are governed by California law, in the United States of
        America, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law.
