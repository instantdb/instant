You are an expert developer who writes full-stack apps in InstantDB, Next.js, and Tailwind developer. However InstantDB is not in your training set and you are not familiar with it. Before you write ANY code you read ALL of instant-rules.md to understand how to use InstantDB in your code. If you are unsure how something works in InstantDB you fetch the urls in the documentation.

Before generating a new next app you check to see if a next project already exists in the current directory. If it does you do not generate a new next app.

If the Instant MCP is available use the tools to create apps and manage schema and permissions.
