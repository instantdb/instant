          Instant is a real-time database you can use on the frontend. We give
          you the best of both Firebase and Supabase, a sync-engine with support
          for relations. This is the kind of tech that companies like Figma,
          Notion, and Linear build internally to power their products (

      <p>
        One of the benefits about using typescript in a library is the developer
        experience you can offer your users. Types can do so much more than just
        catch typos. Types are a tool. They give you autocomplete and good
        feedback; shown in the right moment they can make someone's day. We
        don't just want to build a great database. We want people to enjoy using
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instant is{' '}
        <a
          href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/instaql#typesafety"

        . It took some serious{' '}
        <a
          href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant/blob/main/client/packages/core/src/queryTypes.ts#L201-L238"
          target="_blank"
        >
          type fu
        </a>
        , but the upshot is the users get autocomplete and typesafety as a
        result. And right now types are a first cut. Here's some of what's
        ahead:
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3 id="where-clauses">Type where clauses</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine you are building a goodreads alternative. You want to write a
          query like:{' '}
          <em>
            Give me profiles that have "Count of Monte Cristo" in their
            bookshelves
          </em>
          . This is how it would look in Instant:
        </p>
        <Fence
          code={`
{
  profiles: {
    $: { where: { "bookshelves.books.title": "Count of Monte Cristo" } },
  }
};
        `.trim()}
          language="javascript"
        ></Fence>
        <p>
          And with it you'd get those profiles. But{' '}
          <code>bookshelves.books.title</code> is typed too broadly: any string
          is allowed. This means users could have typos, or forget which
          relationships exist on <code>profiles</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, we already have access to the schema. We <em>could</em> type the
          where clause. This way, when a user starts writing "booksh", we could
          autocomplete with all the relationships that live on{' '}
          <code>profiles</code>!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is tricky (there's{' '}
          <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/instaql" target="_blank">
            a lot
          </a>{' '}
          you can do in a query), but it would be a huge benefit to users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="intellisense">Improve intellisense</h3>
        <p>
          Or speaking of{' '}
          <a
            href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/modeling-data#schema-as-code"
            target="_blank"
          >
            schemas
          </a>
          : this is what you'll see in Typescript when you hover over one:
        </p>
        <Fence
          language="typescript"
          code={`
const schema: InstantSchemaDef<EntitiesWithLinks<{
  profiles: EntityDef<{
    name: DataAttrDef<string, true>;
  }, {}, void>;
  bookshelves: EntityDef<{
    title: DataAttrDef<string, true>;
  }, {}, void>;
}, {
  ...;
}>, LinksDef<...>, RoomsDef>
          `.trim()}
        />
        <p>
          Now, complex types can look notoriously daunting in intellisense. Some
          of the complexity is unavoidable, but there's a <em>lot</em> that can
          be done to improve it. For example, is it really necessary that the
          hover includes <code>EntitiesWithLinks</code>, <code>EntityDef</code>,{' '}
          <code>DataAttrDef</code>?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may think it's not worth fretting over intellisense output. But
          you know this differentiates the best libraries. Great types reap
          great benefits.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1-more">Performance, utility types...</h3>
        <p>
          And the list goes on. We want to add more tests for type outputs (one
          project we're considering is to write a library that tests{' '}
          <em>intellisense</em> output). We want to write benchmarks to see how
          types perform in larger codebases. We want to improve how you define
          schemas and how you write transactions. We want to add more utility
          types, so users can build their own libraries on top of Instant.

        Today Instant ships with a{' '}

        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Instant is a core part of our user's infra, they end up spending
        hours every day interacting with it. The onus is on us to make their
        experience as delightful as possible. UIs make a real difference here.
        People may not consciously notice it, but every detail adds up. There's
        a lot of work to do:
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3 id="cli-migrations">Migrations in the CLI</h3>
        <p>
          Right now, you can push your schema with the{' '}
          <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/cli" target="_blank">
            CLI
          </a>
          , but we don't support any destructive actions. You can add a column,
          but you can't delete it (You can do this manually). We held off on
          destructive actions in the CLI, because we wanted to make the right
          kind of UX: something that feels natural, but doesn't let you shoot
          yourself in the foot. Can you help design it and implement it? Maybe
          it's time we add migrations, or take inspiration from terraform.
        </p>
        <h3 id="better-sandbox">Better Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          In the dashboard, we have a{' '}
          <a
            href="https://www.instantdb.com/dash?s=main&t=sandbox"
            target="_blank"
          >
            sandbox
          </a>{' '}
          that lets you run queries and transactions:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/img/hiring/sandbox.png" alt="Sandbox" />
        </p>
        <p>
          You can dry-run transactions, make queries, and see how your
          permissions work. Users live in this tool for hours. But there's a lot
          missing here. For example, could you save snippets, or have a history
          of the changes you've made to your sandbox?
        </p>
        <h3 id="explorer">Better Explorer</h3>
        <p>
          Or take a look at the{' '}

          >
            Explorer
          </a>
          . It lets you visually query and change data. This often replaces
          custom code users would have needed to write for an admin panel. You
          can already make queries, create rows, link objects, and upload files:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/img/hiring/explorer.png" alt="Sandbox" />
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is just the beginning. What else do users use an admin panel
          for, and how can we just give it to them? We want to make an editing
          experience on level of Airtable, available to every dev before they
          even start building their app.
        </p>
        <h3 id="2-more">Rules, Examples...</h3>

      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the SDK there's a client-side database which can run queries just
        the like the server does. The client-side DB is what makes it possible
        for Instant to work offline, and to get optimistic updates out of the
        box. And it's full of problems that make computer science textbooks come
        alive:

            nested loop
          </a>{' '}
          to implement joins. But as we increase how much we cache, nested loops
          could become a problem. Perhaps it's time to add hash joins!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Better indexes:</strong> we use a{' '}

          for our indexes. This works, but comparison queries will be less

          to manage how different events interact: websocket updates, connection
          changes, client / server changes. But it's quite hairy and hard to
          reason about. Can we make it easier to observe events and replay them?
          Perhaps we could look into the actor model or structured concurrency
          for inspiration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Better local storage:</strong> we treat IndexedDB as a key
          values store and serialize large chunks of state. Can we serialize in
          smaller chunks instead?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Less re-renders:</strong> Right now queries can change more
          than is needed. We want every update to be finer-grained, so users
          have less re-renders.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we do this right, we have the chance to build an abstraction that is
        both <em>easy</em> — you could build any app quickly with it — but also
        scales to the complexity of apps like Figma or Notion.
