        InstantDB: Founding Backend Engineer

        <em>
          Instant is a real-time database you can use on the frontend. We give
          you the best of both Firebase and Supabase, a sync-engine with support
          for relations. This is the kind of tech that companies like Figma,
          Notion, and Linear build internally to power their products (
          <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/tutorial">Try out the demo</a>)
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We're looking for a founding backend engineer to join our team in San
        Francisco. We're looking for someone who:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Enjoys working on hard problems (we're building a database company!)
        </li>
        <li>Wants large scope and plenty of agency</li>
        <li>Has experience working in Clojure or JVM-based languages</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
      <p>
        We're looking to build the next Firebase. We want to make it easier for
        developers to build delightful applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were part of the summer 2022 batch in YC and raised a{' '}

        from a slew of great angels like former Firebase CEO James Tamplin, Paul
        Graham, Greg Brockman, and Jeff Dean
      </p>
      <p>
        Internally we have a hacker mentality â€” we build quickly, we are kind to
        each other, and relentlessly focused on making our users happy. We also
        love sharing our ideas with the broader community, with a slew of our
        essays making the top of HN{' '}

      <h2 id="about-the-role">About the role</h2>
      <p>Our current stack looks like so:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We offer client SDKs, a CLI tool, and web GUI to interact with
          Instant. All written in Typescript
        </li>
        <li>
          We have a server written in Clojure for managing websocket
          connections, parsing queries, running permissions, and broadcasting
          novelty.
        </li>
        <li>All of which sits on top AWS Aurora Postgres</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here are the kinds of problems on the back-end we want to solve next:
      </p>
      <p>
        We're regularly handling {`>10k`} connections but will need to improve
        our infra across our query, transactions, permissions, and reactive
        layers to handle 100k connections and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upgrade our permissions system. Right now Instant's permission system is
        based on Google CEL, similar to Firebase. This has worked for now but we
        think we can do better.{' '}
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-rolled-out-our-own-permissions-dsl-at-figma/">
          Figma
        </a>{' '}
        created their own DSL for writing permissions and we're thinking of
        doing something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enable BYOP (Bring your own Postgres). Today users can only use Instant
        via our hosted or self-hosted solution. Our vision though is that folks
        could bring their existing database and plug it into Instant's sync
        engine. This would enable existing companies to readily adopt Instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are all bigger projects, but there are a lot of quicker wins we
        can deliver too, like giving observability to our developers so they can
        identify and tune problematic queries.
