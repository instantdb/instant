<p>Hello and welcome to Instant’s first newsletter! We’re going to start
sending you updates every month to keep you in the loop with what’s new
:)</p>
<p>Two months ago we launched on Hacker News and open sourced Instant.
Since then we’ve announced our fundraising, set up an office in San
Francisco, and are actively hiring! More info below :)</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>

<p>We were heads down for two years before we finally open sourced at
the end of August. The same day we announced on Hacker News and had one
of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41322281">biggest
show HNs</a> for any YC company, amassing over 1k points. Since then
we’ve gotten over <a href="https://github.com/instantdb/instant">6k
Github stars</a> and over 1k of you are now in <a
href="https://discord.com/invite/VU53p7uQcE">the discord</a>. It’s
energizing to hear your feedback and we’re excited to grow with you!</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising Announcement</strong></p>

<p>A month after open sourcing we announced <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/instant-harkens-back-to-a-pre-google-firebase/">our
fundraising on Techcrunch</a>. We’re honored to be backed by these
fantastic technical angels. We now have an office in San Francisco and
are actively hiring engineers. If you or someone you know are interested
in building infrastructure to power applications of the future, check

<p><strong>Clojure Conj 2024</strong></p>

<p>Our very own Stopa (CTO of Instant), gave a talk about building
Instant at <a href="https://2024.clojure-conj.org/">Clojure Conj</a>
last week! This is the oldest gathering of the Clojure community, which
is the language Instant uses on the backend! During this talk Stopa
discusses how Instant works under the hood. If you enjoyed reading <a

Firebase</a>, you’ll love watching this talk. Will follow-up next month
when the video is ready!</p>
<p><strong>Announcing $users table!</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>With Instant, whether it’s magic codes, Google OAuth, or the Clerk
integration, you can set up auth in a few minutes. But where did those
users live? What if you wanted to query your users, or link them to
objects?</p>
<p>Well now you get a nifty <code>$users</code> table in the explorer to
manage your users. You can query, create links, and and even reference
<code>$users</code> with permissions. These improvements make it much
easier to build role-based apps with security! To learn more, <a

docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Announcing queryOnce!</strong></p>
<p><img

<p><code>useQuery</code> is great, but sometimes you just want to get a
query…once. Well now you can via <code>queryOnce</code></p>
<p>This has been one of the most requested functions on Instant. It’s
really useful when you want to fetch data outside of components, or when
you want to warm up the cache for route transitions. We had it live for
the last few weeks, and were watching it to fix bugs. Starting today
consider <code>queryOnce</code> out of beta!</p>
<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
<p>We’re focused on making the core Instant experience great. Since open
sourcing we’ve launched a few beta features, our goal for this next
month is to get them across the finish line. Next month you can expect
to see improvements for storage, strong init, the instant-cli tool, and
instaql!</p>
<p>Stay tuned :)</p>
<p><strong>We are hiring founding engineers!</strong></p>
<p>We’re a team of 3 right now hacking away in our new San Francisco
office and we’re looking to grow! If you’re interested in working on
some of the hardest problems for modern app development drop us a line
at founders@instantdb.com with a resume and a side project you’ve worked
on (including a Github is a huge plus!)</p>
