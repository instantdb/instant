<p>Hey crew! Itâ€™s time for another edition of Instant News ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s a
slice of what happened in December!</p>
<p><strong>Order by attributes</strong></p>

<p>Previously, you could order by <code>serverCreatedAt</code>, but not
much else. This is because we didnâ€™t have a way to make
<code>order</code> queries fast.</p>
<p>Once we introduced type checked attributes, suddenly the path for
fast order queries opened up. Starting from <code>0.17.0</code>, you can
use <code>order</code> on type-checked and indexed attributes.</p>

docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sign in with Apple</strong></p>

<p>Weâ€™ve had sign in with magic codes, Google, Clerk, and custom auth
flows via the admin SDK. Well now Instant provides support for signing
in with Apple too! We support a popup flow, a web redirect, and a
dedicated React Native flow! <a

more in the docs</a></p>
<p><strong>Type-safe init by default!</strong> We launched type
enforcement on the backend last month and this month we made type-safe
<code>init</code> the default. Previously to get type-safety on the
frontend you had to use a separate <code>init_experimental</code> flow.
Now you can just import your schema and pass it to <code>init</code></p>

<p>We made sure to do this in a backwards compatible way, so upgrading
to the latest version shouldnâ€™t cause any headaches. To learn more about
backwards compatibility check out our announcement on <a

<p><strong>Whatâ€™s next?</strong></p>
<p>Itâ€™s been an awesome year for us at Instant, the platform has grown
so much thanks to all your feedback. Instant is on completely different
level compared to <a

mvp from one year ago</a>. So excited to make another magnitude jump in
2025 and make Instant the new default for folks who want to ship the
best applications fast!</p>
<p>Hope you had a wonderful holidays and looking forward to hacking
together in 2025!</p>
