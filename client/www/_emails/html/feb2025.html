<p>Hey crew! Itâ€™s time for another edition of Instant News ðŸ™‚ This time
itâ€™s a double issue! Hereâ€™s a slice of what happened since the start of
the year!</p>
<p><strong>Upgraded Explorer</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Explorer got a slew of updates! Hereâ€™s a rundown of what got
shipped</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can select fields and start querying for strings. Or use a
comparison operator. Or set an exact match for something like an ID.
This should make it much easier to find and filter rows!</p></li>
<li><p>We built a UI for adding links between entities! Beforehand you
needed to either use the Sandbox or create links via a script. This
should make working with links much easier</p></li>
<li><p>We added deep-linking to the explorer. This should hopefully make
it a little easier to navigate the explorer using the forward/back
buttons and allow you to directly send links to your team to get to a
specific explorer state!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We hope these improvements make working with Instant more
delightful!</p>
<p><strong>Cascade on delete</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Sometimes, objects depend on each other. If you delete a â€˜postâ€™, all
its comments should be deleted. Now you can make sure of that with a
click in your Explorer.</p>
<p>We wanted to be thoughtful about this feature and make sure that it
was performant for you so all on-delete cascades happen in one call
under the hood! <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/modeling-data#cascade-delete">Check
out the docs</a> to learn more!</p>
<p><strong>Storage available for all</strong></p>
<p>You should now see a new <code>$files</code> namespace for all apps
in your explorer. Similar to the <code>$users</code> namespace, this a
special system namespace which contains data you can use to upload and
serve assets in your apps.</p>
<p>Uploading is as easy as one line â€“
<code>db.storage.uploadFile("hello-world", file)</code></p>
<p>You can then retrieve urls by querying the <code>$files</code>
namespace.</p>
<p><img

<p><code>$files</code> works like any other table. This means you can
link files to other namespaces, filter them, sort them, and do some cool
queries.</p>
<p>It also means you can set <code>CASCADE DELETE</code> on files. So
when a profile is deleted, all associated assets can be automagically
deleted for you as well. You can see storage live in our <a
href="https://x.com/instant_db/status/1892712087245185261">announcement
tweet</a> and a <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/storage#storage-quick-start">full
example in our docs.</a></p>
<p>Storage is now available for all apps. Free apps can store up to 1GB
and paid ups can store up to 10GB and then $0.125/GB after.</p>
<p><strong>Select fields</strong></p>
<p>By default InstaQL queries fetch all the fields for an object.
Sometimes though you donâ€™t need all the data and just want stub or a
subset. You can now do this via the <code>fields</code> clause.</p>
<p><img
src="https://www.instantdb.com/img/emails/feb2025/s_513F5FE60B9BB3BB9CCD1CA54DF394804C0DE8F72ED1A4C65882EB8C31D175AE_1741040505548_image.png" /></p>
<p>The <code>fields</code> clause can also be used in <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/instaql#select-fields">nested
relations</a>. This is particularly helpful for reducing the payload for
your queries!</p>
<p><strong>And a few more things!</strong></p>
<p>More wins that got shipped thanks to your feedback!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="citation"
data-cites="instandb/react-native">@instandb/react-native</span></strong>
now uses IndexedDB for react-native-web contexts, matching the behavior
of our web react package.</p></li>
<li><p>We updated <strong>rooms</strong> to use static hooks and return
stable values. This remove type warnings and improve perf when using
presence!</p></li>
<li><p>We made the devtool more configurable, you can now choose where
you want to place the dev tool (vercel puts their dev-tool in the bottom
left, so you can now move Instantâ€™s to the bottom-right). You can also
configure the allowed hosts for the devtool in case you run dev outside
of localhost</p></li>
<li><p>We also updated the CLI to enabling load
<strong>instant.schema.ts</strong> and <strong>instant.perms.ts</strong>
from a custom path.</p></li>
<li><p>For those who love reading technical content, we published an <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/pg_upgrade">essay</a> on our
zero-downtime migration to Postgres 16, leading to some great discussion
on <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42867657">HN</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Whatâ€™s next?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve got some awesome features coming out next month! Weâ€™re also
going to lean into making LLMs understand Instant. Weâ€™re pretty excited
so stay tuned :)</p>
