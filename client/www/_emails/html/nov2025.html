<p>Hey crew! It’s time for another edition of Instant News 🙂 Here’s a
slice of what happened last month!</p>
<p><strong>Upgraded LLM Rules and MCP</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>If you’re using the MCP you’ll also notice we updated it to support
ad-hoc queries, transactions, and full schema migrations. Now agents can
fully manage your Instant apps!</p>
<p>Previously we had platform-specific LLM rules for NextJS and Expo. We
would include a full example app to get best results from the agent.</p>
<p>In the last month we updated our CLI tools, shipped better messages,
saw new models come out, <a
href="https://x.com/instant_db/status/1993053808113627599?s=20">and
released new rules</a>. We used them to build three versions of Counter
Strike comparing <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/gpt_52_on_the_counterstrike_benchmark">Codex,
Claude Code, and Gemini</a> (and just recently updated to <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/gpt_52_on_the_counterstrike_benchmark">include
GPT 5.2</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Better Explorer and Sandbox Updates</strong></p>

<p>We know how delightful it can be when working with your data to that
end we made some serious improvements to the Explorer. You can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export data from the explorer to CSV, Markdown, or JSON.</li>
<li>Drag to re-order columns in the explorer.</li>
<li>Drag to re-size columns in the explorer</li>
<li>Click to auto-resize columns</li>
<li>And have all your preferences saved on refresh!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also added the ability to restore recently deleted namespaces. If
you or your agent accidentally deleted a whole table of data you can now
restore it with just one click!</p>
<p><strong>Examples Page</strong></p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/examples">added a new
examples</a> page to show you how to use queries, transactions, auth,
storage, and presence to build common types of apps. If you find these
useful and have requests for other kinds of apps let us know and we’ll
build more!</p>
<p><strong>Firebase Auth</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Instant now supports Firebase auth! This is useful if you have an
existing Firebase project, but it’s also useful <strong>if you want to
use phone number auth in your Instant projects</strong>. <a
