<p>Hey crew! It‚Äôs time for another edition of Instant News üôÇ Here‚Äôs a
slice of what happened last month!</p>
<p><strong>ruleParams</strong></p>

<p>Imagine you have a <code>documents</code> namespace, and want to
implement a rule like <em>‚ÄúOnly people who know my document‚Äôs id can
access it.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>You can now express this kind of logic with <code>ruleParams</code>.
In the example above we pass a <code>knownDocId</code> param to our
query and then use it in our permission rules. We leverage this
ourselves to implement our new feedback feature at the bottom of each
page in the docs. Click <a

<p>To make it easier to use Instant we‚Äôve put together an <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/llms.txt">llms.txt</a> and <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/llms-full.txt">llms-full.txt</a> that
you can paste or download to use as context for your LLM of choice. Add
these as context to Cursor or paste them into Claude to easily build
apps like this <a href="https://instant-llm-test.vercel.app/">blog
platform</a> and <a
href="https://instant-evernote-clone.vercel.app/login">Evernote
clone</a></p>
<p>If you have any feedback on your experience using LLMs w/ Instant we
would love to hear it on <a

<p>Instant supports the standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant
flow, enabling users to authorize your application to access their
Instant data and perform actions on their behalf, like reading app
details or managing apps.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre building a platform and want to spin up separate databases
for your users check out <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/auth/platform-oauth">our docs</a>
for step by step instructions!</p>

<p><a href="https://heroui.chat/">HeroUI Chat</a> is an AI app builder
that turns prompts or screenshots into React applications. Built on top
of their open-source HeroUI library (23k+ stars, 600k+ downloads)
<strong>and Instant!</strong> They hit <a
href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/heroui-chat">#1 on Product
Hunt!</a> We‚Äôre thrilled to be powering them!</p>
<p><strong>And a few more things!</strong></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a few more wins that got shipped thanks to your feedback!</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now shift+click in the explorer to easily select a range of
values</li>
<li>You can explicitly set values to <code>null</code> in the
explorer</li>
<li><code>db.auth.signOut</code> now accepts <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#sign-out">refresh
tokens</a> and user ids (previously only accepted emails). This means
you can now log out users from one device instead of all devices if you
like.</li>
<li>You can now use <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/patterns#making-local-ids">db.useLocalId</a>
to generate ids for non-authed users. This is especially useful for
guest-mode features!</li>
<li>Want to get who‚Äôs online in a room from your backend? You can now
use <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#presence-in-the-backend">adminDB.rooms.getPresence</a>!</li>
<li>Want to integrate db.query in NextJS caching system? Just pass in
options with <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/docs/patterns#making-admin-queries-work-with-next-js-caching">fetchOpts</a></li>
<li>We published an <a
href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/pg_upgrade">essay</a> on why sync
engines are the future, leading to some great discussion on <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43397640">HN</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs next?</strong> We‚Äôve got some more features and LLM
improvements coming next month. If you have any suggestion on how we can
make Instant more useful for you, we‚Äôre all ears :)</p>
