Hey crew! It’s time for another edition of Instant News 🙂 Here’s a slice of what happened last month!

**Upgraded LLM Rules and MCP**

![](https://www.instantdb.com/img/emails/nov2025/s_034DCCA0D256C7191F3B34B2A61E1BA03201911C85FBF968D0C0DB98256C5F1B_1765583579812_image.png)

If you’re using the MCP you’ll also notice we updated it to support ad-hoc queries, transactions, and full schema migrations. Now agents can fully manage your Instant apps!

Previously we had platform-specific LLM rules for NextJS and Expo. We would include a full example app to get best results from the agent.

In the last month we updated our CLI tools, shipped better messages, saw new models come out, [and released new rules](https://x.com/instant_db/status/1993053808113627599?s=20). We used them to build three versions of Counter Strike comparing [Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/gpt_52_on_the_counterstrike_benchmark) (and just recently updated to [include GPT 5.2](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/gpt_52_on_the_counterstrike_benchmark)).

**Better Explorer and Sandbox Updates**

We know how delightful it can be when working with your data to that end we made some serious improvements to the Explorer. You can now:

* Export data from the explorer to CSV, Markdown, or JSON.
* Drag to re-order columns in the explorer.
* Drag to re-size columns in the explorer
* Click to auto-resize columns
* And have all your preferences saved on refresh!

We also added the ability to restore recently deleted namespaces. If you or your agent accidentally deleted a whole table of data you can now restore it with just one click!

**Examples Page**

We [added a new examples](https://www.instantdb.com/examples) page to show you how to use queries, transactions, auth, storage, and presence to build common types of apps. If you find these useful and have requests for other kinds of apps let us know and we’ll build more!

**Firebase Auth**

![](https://www.instantdb.com/img/emails/nov2025/s_034DCCA0D256C7191F3B34B2A61E1BA03201911C85FBF968D0C0DB98256C5F1B_1765585971695_image.png)

Instant now supports Firebase auth! This is useful if you have an existing Firebase project, but it’s also useful **if you want to use phone number auth in your Instant projects**. [Check out our docs](https://x.com/instant_db/status/1987951753103630468?s=20) to learn more!

**Customer Spotlight: Eden**

[Eden](https://eden.so/) lets you upload files, YouTube links, and more to a **better drive** that can always find what you need. You can then connect your data to AI on a visual canvas. They [had a big launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU4UxKOVQLI\&t=667s) over Thanksgiving weekend which brought in over 10k users. We’re thrilled to be powering them!

**Bonus: Sync Conf event with Expo!**

We hosted [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [100+ hackers](https://x.com/instant_db/status/1988679625707606440?s=20) at our office as part of Sync Conf. Was a treat to see so many of y’all excited about sync!

We know the holidays are near! If you’re looking to hack on [something fun](https://www.savetrippy.com/) this break, give `npx create-instant-app` a shot 🚀
