Hey crew! Itâ€™s time for another edition of Instant News ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s a slice of what happened last month!

**Create Instant App**

![](https://www.instantdb.com/img/emails/aug2025/s_1792D73BA27A4373955C0EF2F9F74DE0BD9019C65C1CBCC322C4DF65A41CF048_1757625254421_CleanShot+2025-09-11+at+14.14.002x.png)

Ever wanted to spin up an Instant project quickly? Well now you can with `npx create-instant-app`

We have pre-built templates for Next, Vanilla Vite, and Expo.

Each project will come up with all the Instant bits prepared for you: from the schema to the DB to an example app to show you how the API works.

Youâ€™ll also get all the LLM rules baked in, so you can start coding with your favorite agent!

**One shot apps with Claude Code**

If you have Claude code you can use create-instant-app to one shot apps directly from your terminal. [Hereâ€™s a 90 second clip of it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzhtAJ3fVJM\&ab_channel=InstantDB).

You can try it out by running the following command from your terminal

`npx create-instant-app --ai`

Pass along a prompt and get the first version of your app built! It can be a great way to get started, and then you have a codebase you can evolve.

**SignedIn and SignedOut Components**

Conditionally rendering signed in and signed out states is one most common pieces of logic you need to write in your app. [This is now easier to write with Instant.](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/auth)

* You can now use `db.SignedIn` and `db.SignedOut` to switch between authenticated and non authenticated components.
* Once youâ€™re logged in, you can use `db.useUser` to get the current user.

Previously we exported a useAuth hook that included a loading and error state. With the new useUser hook you donâ€™t need to write extraneous checks on whether the user is really really logged in or not.

We recommend you migrate most of your logic to `useUser` !

**Subscriptions on the backend**

![](https://www.instantdb.com/img/emails/aug2025/s_1792D73BA27A4373955C0EF2F9F74DE0BD9019C65C1CBCC322C4DF65A41CF048_1757627747678_CleanShot+2025-09-11+at+14.55.302x.png)

When we started working on Instant we were focused on reactivity for the frontend. One feature request that we saw over and over was to allow for subscriptions on the backend. Folks who wanted this would need to setup polling as a workaround.

Well now we have a solution for this â€” you can use `adminDB.subscribeQuery` to listen for query changes on the backend! [Check out the docs](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#subscriptions-on-the-backend) to learn more!

**And a few more things!**

Hereâ€™s a few more wins that got shipped!

* We shipped a major improvement to our query plans! This unlocks much heavier usage for Instant!
* We published two case studies highlighting [how teams](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/mirando) are using [Instant in production](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/heroui)
* The admin sdk now supports uploading streams and [impersonating users](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#impersonating-users) with storage

**Whatâ€™s next**

Today our llm rules are optimized for Next.js apps. Weâ€™re going to be releasing templates for Vanilla Vite and Expo. Weâ€™re also going to make managing your apps via the CLI and MCP even better. Weâ€™ll also be rolling out organization features to support startups and enterprises â€” if youâ€™ve been thinking about using Instant at your work or your company, weâ€™d love to talk!
