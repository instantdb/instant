Hello and welcome to Instant’s first newsletter! We’re going to start sending you updates every month to keep you in the loop with what’s new :)

Two months ago we launched on Hacker News and open sourced Instant. Since then we’ve announced our fundraising, set up an office in San Francisco, and are actively hiring! More info below :)

**Open Source**

We were heads down for two years before we finally open sourced at the end of August. The same day we announced on Hacker News and had one of the [biggest show HNs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41322281) for any YC company, amassing over 1k points. Since then we’ve gotten over [6k Github stars](https://github.com/instantdb/instant) and over 1k of you are now in [the discord](https://discord.com/invite/VU53p7uQcE). It’s energizing to hear your feedback and we’re excited to grow with you!

**Fundraising Announcement**

A month after open sourcing we announced [our fundraising on Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/instant-harkens-back-to-a-pre-google-firebase/). We’re honored to be backed by these fantastic technical angels. We now have an office in San Francisco and are actively hiring engineers.

**Clojure Conj 2024**

Our very own Stopa (CTO of Instant), gave a talk about building Instant at [Clojure Conj](https://2024.clojure-conj.org/) last week! This is the oldest gathering of the Clojure community, which is the language Instant uses on the backend! During this talk Stopa discusses how Instant works under the hood. If you enjoyed reading [A Graph-Based Firebase](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/next_firebase), you’ll love watching this talk. Will follow-up next month when the video is ready!

**Announcing $users table!**

With Instant, whether it’s magic codes, Google OAuth, or the Clerk integration, you can set up auth in a few minutes. But where did those users live? What if you wanted to query your users, or link them to objects?

Well now you get a nifty `$users` table in the explorer to manage your users. You can query, create links, and and even reference `$users` with permissions. These improvements make it much easier to build role-based apps with security! To learn more, [check out our $users docs](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/users).

**Announcing queryOnce!**

![](https://www.instantdb.com/img/emails/oct2024/s_DF8F10A9009F2A236BC7D07C4EC05DDA50E4FB82F40AA98593D3B98A1A7EA3DC_1730244001267_image.png)

`useQuery` is great, but sometimes you just want to get a query…once. Well now you can via `queryOnce`

This has been one of the most requested functions on Instant. It’s really useful when you want to fetch data outside of components, or when you want to warm up the cache for route transitions. We had it live for the last few weeks, and were watching it to fix bugs. Starting today consider `queryOnce` out of beta!

**What’s next?**

We’re focused on making the core Instant experience great. Since open sourcing we’ve launched a few beta features, our goal for this next month is to get them across the finish line. Next month you can expect to see improvements for storage, strong init, the instant-cli tool, and instaql!

Stay tuned :)

**We are hiring founding engineers!**

We’re a team of 3 right now hacking away in our new San Francisco office and we’re looking to grow! If you’re interested in working on some of the hardest problems for modern app development drop us a line at founders@instantdb.com with a resume and a side project you’ve worked on (including a Github is a huge plus!)
