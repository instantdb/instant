Hey crew! Itâ€™s time for another edition of Instant News ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s a slice of what happened last month!

**ruleParams**

Imagine you have a `documents` namespace, and want to implement a rule like _"Only people who know my document's id can access it."_

You can now express this kind of logic with `ruleParams`. In the example above we pass a `knownDocId` param to our query and then use it in our permission rules. We leverage this ourselves to implement our new feedback feature at the bottom of each page in the docs. Click [here to learn more](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/permissions#rule-params)

**LLMs.txt**

To make it easier to use Instant we've put together an [llms.txt](https://www.instantdb.com/llms.txt) and [llms-full.txt](https://www.instantdb.com/llms-full.txt) that you can paste or download to use as context for your LLM of choice. Add these as context to Cursor or paste them into Claude to easily build apps like this [blog platform](https://instant-llm-test.vercel.app/) and [Evernote clone](https://instant-evernote-clone.vercel.app/login)

If you have any feedback on your experience using LLMs w/ Instant we would love to hear it on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VU53p7uQcE)!

**OAuth Platform**

Instant supports the standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant flow, enabling users to authorize your application to access their Instant data and perform actions on their behalf, like reading app details or managing apps.

If youâ€™re building a platform and want to spin up separate databases for your users check out [our docs](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/auth/platform-oauth) for step by step instructions!

**Customer Spotlight**

[HeroUI Chat](https://heroui.chat/) is an AI app builder that turns prompts or screenshots into React applications. Built on top of their open-source HeroUI library (23k+ stars, 600k+ downloads) **and Instant!** They hit [#1 on Product Hunt!](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/heroui-chat) Weâ€™re thrilled to be powering them!

**And a few more things!**

Hereâ€™s a few more wins that got shipped thanks to your feedback!

- You can now shift+click in the explorer to easily select a range of values
- You can explicitly set values to `null` in the explorer
- `db.auth.signOut` now accepts [refresh tokens](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#sign-out) and user ids (previously only accepted emails). This means you can now log out users from one device instead of all devices if you like.
- You can now use [db.useLocalId](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/patterns#making-local-ids) to generate ids for non-authed users. This is especially useful for guest-mode features!
- Want to get whoâ€™s online in a room from your backend? You can now use [adminDB.rooms.getPresence](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#presence-in-the-backend)!
- Want to integrate db.query in NextJS caching system? Just pass in options with [fetchOpts](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/patterns#making-admin-queries-work-with-next-js-caching)
- We published an [essay](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/pg_upgrade) on why sync engines are the future, leading to some great discussion on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43397640).

**Whatâ€™s next?**
Weâ€™ve got some more features and LLM improvements coming next month. If you have any suggestion on how we can make Instant more useful for you, weâ€™re all ears :)
