Hey crew! It‚Äôs time for another edition of Instant News üôÇ Over the last 3 months we were heads down beefing up Instant as a platform. We‚Äôve got a lot of news to share in this edition!

**New Tutorial**

You can now build full-stack apps directly from your IDE or terminal using Instant. [We put together a whirlwind tutorial to experience what we mean.](https://www.instantdb.com/tutorial) If you ever wanted to share Instant with others, sending them the tutorial may be the easiest way for them to give us a spin.

**Use Instant with** **Agents**

When we started building Instant we wanted something great for builders. We wanted to offer lots of great abstractions and a generous free tier where projects aren't limited or paused. To make this work we built Instant to be multi-tenant.

Turns out when you make something great for humans, it also works great for agents. Agents can use all the batteries Instant provides to write high-level code that‚Äôs easier for them to write, and for humans to review. Combine that with multi-tenant infrastructure, and humans and agents can spin up millions of databases in milliseconds.

To that end we have a slew of releases to make agents sing with Instant

* A [Platform SDK](https://github.com/instantdb/instant/tree/main/client/packages/platform) which lets you programmatically create and manage Instant databases.
* An [MCP server](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/using-llms#instant-mcp-server) that lets you leverage the Platform SDK via Cursor, Claude, or your agent of choice.
* A [set of rules](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/using-llms#instant-rules) that teaches agents how to use Instant.

If you‚Äôre interested in using Instant as a platform for spinning up databases feel free to reach out to us at founders@instantdb.com

**Better types for queries and presence!**

`$.where` filters now give more specific autocomplete options and errors!

For example, `$isNull` will only autocomplete for fields marked as optional, and `$ilike` will only autocomplete for indexed fields. Even stronger query and transaction validations are coming too.

We‚Äôve also shipped improve for Room/Presence types! Typescript hover documentation for our presence hooks should be much easier to parse at a glance. In addition we have also exported some additional types to make building wrappers and utilities for presence easier üî•

**Better transactions!**

Historically, Instant used `update` for both creating new entities and updating existing ones. Now we support `create` as [as a separate operation](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/instaml#creating-data).

Additionally, `update` now supports an `upsert: false` option, turning it into a ‚Äústrict update‚Äù. Like `create` prevents updates on existing entities, strict update prevents creation of new entities!

**New essays and demos!**

In the last few months we released a few more essays, tutorials, and even had a video of Instant featured on Expo‚Äôs channel! Here‚Äôs a high level overview of all our new content!

* [Step-by-step written tutorial](https://expo.dev/blog/what-if-usestate-was-your-backend) showing you how to build an emoji chat application with Expo.
* [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEJIcaGN3vY) showing how to build a collaborative sketch board with Expo.
* [An essay](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/agents) on how we think agents will ship software in the future
* A [comparison of Chat GPT-5 vs Opus 4.1](https://www.instantdb.com/essays/gpt_5_vs_opus_4) vibe-coding full-stack apps

**And a few more things!**

Here‚Äôs a few more wins that happened in the last few months!

* Instant welcomed Drew to the team in in July ‚Äî we‚Äôre now a team of 5! He‚Äôs got typescript chops, one of the best Neovim setups we‚Äôve seen, and he's making PR after PR to improve Instant‚Äôs devex.
  * He‚Äôs responsible for shipping the typesafety wins in this update!
* You can search for `null` values in the explorer
* You can use `update` for `$files` to [change paths](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/storage#update-file-paths)
* You can [send and verify magic codes on the backend](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/backend#custom-magic-codes)
* You can [configure queries](https://www.instantdb.com/docs/init#configuration-options) to return date objects for `i.date()` columns.

**What‚Äôs next**

We‚Äôve been chipping away at some big infra wins. We‚Äôre seeing more folks build bigger apps and we‚Äôre excited to support them as they scale! Stay tuned for some exciting news next month :)
