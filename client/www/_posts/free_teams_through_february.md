February is all about celebrating the people you care about, so we're making team features free through the end of February. You can invite as many members as you like to your free Instant apps and orgs as long as you add them before the end of February.

At the end of of February, the members you added will still be able to access your app. You just won't be able to add new members until you convert to a paid app.

This is an experiment for us. We're hoping that free teams will encourage people to add their team members to their Instant apps earlier. It takes a lot to convince your coworkers to use a new database. If we make it easy to bring them in earlier, before you're required to put down a credit card, will companies be more likely to adopt Instant for their projects? We're going to find out!
