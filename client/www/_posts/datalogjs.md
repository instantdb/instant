Query engines make me feel like a wizard. I cast my incantation: “Give me all the directors and the movies where Arnold Schwarzenegger was a cast member”. Then charges zip through wires, algorithms churn on CPUs, and voila, an answer bubbles up.

How do they work? In this essay, we will build a query engine from scratch and find out. In 100 lines of Javascript, we’ll supports joins, indexes, _and_ find our answer for Arnold! Let’s get into it.

# Choice

Our first step is to choose which language we’ll support. SQL is the most popular, but we wouldn’t get far in 100 lines. I suggest we amble off the beaten path and make Datalog instead.

If you haven’t heard of Datalog, you’re in for a treat. It’s a logic-based query language that’s as powerful as SQL. We won’t cover it completely, but we’ll cover enough to fit a good weekend’s worth of hacking.

To grok Datalog, we need to understand three ideas:

# Data

The first idea is about how we store data.

## SQL Tables

SQL databases store data in different tables:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650557040594_image.png)

Here we have a `movie` table, which stores one movie per row. The record with the id `200` is `"The Terminator"`.

Notice the `director_id`. This points to a row in yet another `person` table, which keeps the director’s name, and so on.

## Datalog Triples

In Datalog databases, there are no tables. Or really everything is just stored in one table, the `triple` table:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650653844960_image.png)

A `triple` is a row with an `id`, `attribute`, and `value`. Triples have a curious property; with just these three columns, they can describe any kind of information!

How? Imagine describing a movie to someone:

> It's called "The Terminator"
> It was released in 1987

Those sentences conveniently translate to triples:

```javascript
[200, movie / title, 'The Terminator'][(200, movie / year, 1987)];
```

And those sentences have a general structure; if you can describe a movie this way, you can describe tomatoes or airplanes just as well.

# Queries

The second idea is about how we search for information.

## SQL Algebra

SQL has roots in relational algebra. You give the query engine a combination of clauses and statements, and it gets you back your data:

```sql
SELECT id FROM movie WHERE year = 1987
```

This returns:

```javascript
[{ id: 202 }, { id: 203 }, { id: 204 }];
```

Voila, the movie ids for Predator, Lethal Weapon, and RoboCop.

## Datalog Pattern Matching

Datalog databases rely on pattern matching. We create “patterns” that match against triples. For example, to find all the movies released in 1987, we could use this pattern:

```javascript
[?id, movie/year, 1987]
```

Here, `?id` is a variable: we’re telling the query engine that it can be _any_ value. But, the `attribute` _must_ be `movie/year`, and the `value` _must_ be `1987`.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650395773008_image.png)

Our query engine runs through triple after triple. Since `?id` can be anything, this matches every triple. But, the attribute `movie/year` and the value `1987` filter us down to _just_ the triples we care about:

```javascript
[
  [202, movie / year, 1987],
  [203, movie / year, 1987],
  [204, movie / year, 1987],
];
```

Notice the `?id` portion; those are the ids for Predator, Lethal Weapon, and RoboCop!

## Datalog `find`

In SQL, we _just_ got back ids though, while our query engine returned more. How can we support returning ids only? Let’s adjust our syntax; here’s `find`:

```javascript
{ find: [?id],
  where: [
    [?id, movie/year, 1987]
  ] }
```

Our query engine can now use the `find` section to return what we care about. If we implement this right, we should get back:

```javascript
[[202], [203], [204]];
```

And now we’re as dandy as SQL.

# Joins

The third idea is about how joins work. Datalog and SQL’s magic comes from them.

## SQL clauses

In SQL, if we wanted to find “The Terminator’s” director, we could write:

```javascript
SELECT
  person.name
FROM movie
JOIN person ON movie.director_id = person.id
WHERE movie.title = "The Terminator"
```

Which gets us:

```javascript
[{ name: 'James Cameron' }];
```

Pretty cool. We used the `JOIN` clause to connect the movie table with the person table, and bam, we got our director’s name.

## Datalog…Pattern Matching

In Datalog, we still rely on pattern matching. The trick is to match _multiple_ patterns:

```javascript
{
  find: [?directorName],
  where: [
    [?movieId, movie/title, "The Terminator"],
    [?movieId, movie/director, ?directorId],
    [?directorId, person/name, ?directorName],
  ],
}
```

Here we tell the query engine to match _three_ patterns. The first pattern produces a list of successful triples. For each successful triple, we search again with the _second_ pattern, and so on. Notice how the `?movieId` and `?directorId` are repeated; this tells our query engine that for a successful match, those values would need to be the _same_ across our different searches.

What do I mean? Let’s make this concrete; here’s how our query engine could find The Terminator’s director:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650461792727_image.png)

The first pattern finds:

```javascript
[200, movie/title, "The Terminator"].
```

We bind `?movieId` to `200`. Now we start searching for the second pattern:

```javascript
[?movieId, movie/director, ?directorName].
```

Since `?movieId` needs to be `200`, this finds us

```javascript
[200, movie / director, 100];
```

And we can now bind `?directorId` to `100`. Time for the third pattern:

```javascript
[?directorId, person/name, ?directorName]
```

Because `?directorId` has to be `100`, our engine finds us:

```javascript
[100, person / name, 'James Cameron'];
```

And perfecto, the `?directorName` is now bound to `"James Cameron"`! The `find` section would then return `["James Cameron"]`.

---

Oky doke, now we grok the basics of Datalog! Let’s get to the code.

# Syntax

First things first, we need a way to represent this syntax. If you look at:

```javascript
{ find: [?id],
  where: [
    [?id, movie/year, 1987]
  ] }
```

We could _almost_ write this in Javascript. We use objects and arrays, but `?id` and `movie/year` get in the way; they would throw an error. We can fix this with a hack: let’s turn them into strings.

```javascript
{ find: ["?id"],
  where: [
    ["?id", "movie/year", 1987]
  ] }
```

It’s less pretty, but we can now express our queries without fanfare. If a string begins with a question mark, it’s a variable. An attribute is just a string; it’s a good idea to include a namespace like `"movie/*"`, but we won’t force our users.

# Sample Data

The next thing we’ll need is sample data to play with. There’s a great datalog tutorial [^1], which has the movie dataset we’ve been describing. I’ve taken it and adapted it to Javascript. [Here’s the file](https://github.com/stopachka/datalogJS/blob/main/src/exampeTriples.js).

```javascript
// exampleTriples.js
export default [
  [100, 'person/name', 'James Cameron'],
  [100, 'person/born', '1954-08-16T00:00:00Z'],
  // ...
];
```

Let’s plop this in and require it:

```javascript
import exampleTriples from './exampleTriples';
```

Now for our query engine!

# matchPattern

## Goal

Our first goal is to match _one_ pattern with _one_ triple. Here’s an example:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650419195277_image.png)

We have some variable bindings: `{"?movieId": 200}`. Let’s call this a `context`.

Our goal is to take a pattern, a triple, and a context. We’ll either return a new context:

```javascript
{"?movieId": 200, "?directorId": 100}
```

Or a failure. We can just say `null` means failure.

This could be the test we play with:

```javascript
expect(
  matchPattern(
    ['?movieId', 'movie/director', '?directorId'],
    [200, 'movie/director', 100],
    { '?movieId': 200 },
  ),
).toEqual({ '?movieId': 200, '?directorId': 100 });
expect(
  matchPattern(
    ['?movieId', 'movie/director', '?directorId'],
    [200, 'movie/director', 100],
    { '?movieId': 202 },
  ),
).toEqual(null);
```

## Code

Nice, we have a plan. Let’s write the larger function first:

```javascript
function matchPattern(pattern, triple, context) {
  return pattern.reduce((context, patternPart, idx) => {
    const triplePart = triple[idx];
    return matchPart(patternPart, triplePart, context);
  }, context);
}
```

We take our pattern, and compare each part to the corresponding one in our triple:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650457636669_image.png)

So, we’d compare `"?movieId"` with `200`, and so on.

## matchPart

We can delegate this comparison to `matchPart`:

```javascript
function matchPart(patternPart, triplePart, context) {
  if (!context) return null;
  if (isVariable(patternPart)) {
    return matchVariable(patternPart, triplePart, context);
  }
  return patternPart === triplePart ? context : null;
}
```

First we address `context`; if `context` was `null` we must have failed before, so we just return early.

## isVariable

Next, we check if we’re looking at a variable. `isVariable` is simple enough:

```javascript
function isVariable(x) {
  return typeof x === 'string' && x.startsWith('?');
}
```

## matchVariable

Now, if we _are_ looking at a variable, we’d want to handle it especially:

```javascript
function matchVariable(variable, triplePart, context) {
  if (context.hasOwnProperty(variable)) {
    const bound = context[variable];
    return matchPart(bound, triplePart, context);
  }
  return { ...context, [variable]: triplePart };
}
```

We would check if we _already_ have a binding for this variable. For example, when comparing `?movieId`, we’d already have the binding: “`200`”. In this case, we just compare the bound value with what’s in our triple.

```javascript
// ...
if (context.hasOwnProperty(variable)) {
  const bound = context[variable];
  return matchPart(bound, triplePart, context);
}
// ...
```

When we compare `?directorId` though, we’d see that this variable wasn’t bound. In this case, we’d want to _expand_ our context. We’d attach `?directorId` to the corresponding part in our triple (`100`).

```javascript
return { ...context, [variable]: triplePart };
```

Finally, if we weren’t looking at a variable, we would have skipped this and just checked for equality. If the pattern part and the triple part match, we keep the context; otherwise we return null:

```javascript
// ...
return patternPart === triplePart ? context : null;
// ...
```

And with that, `matchPattern` works as we like!

# querySingle

## Goal

Now for our second goal. We can already match one pattern with one triple. Let’s now match _one_ pattern with _multiple_ triples. Here’s the idea:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650458051668_image.png)

We’ll have _one_ pattern and a database of triples. We’ll want to return the contexts for all the successful matches. Here’s the test we can play with:

```javascript
expect(
  querySingle(['?movieId', 'movie/year', 1987], exampleTriples, {}),
).toEqual([{ '?movieId': 202 }, { '?movieId': 203 }, { '?movieId': 204 }]);
```

## Code

Well, much of the work comes down to `matchPattern`. Here’s all `querySingle` needs to do:

```javascript
function querySingle(pattern, db, context) {
  return db
    .map((triple) => matchPattern(pattern, triple, context))
    .filter((x) => x);
}
```

We go over each triple and run `matchPattern`. This would return either a `context` (it’s a match!), or `null` (it’s a failure). We `filter` to remove the failures, and querySingle works like a charm!

# queryWhere

## Goal

Closer and closer. Now to support joins. We need to handle _multiple_ patterns:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_FD7FF9539594E6B532630EAEC892A2984C0B1FD8174F6609827754AA4559A821_1650462526590_image.png)

So we go pattern by pattern, and find successful triples. For each successful triple, we apply the next pattern. At the end, we’ll have produced progressively larger contexts.

Here’s the test we can play with:

```javascript
expect(
  queryWhere(
    [
      ['?movieId', 'movie/title', 'The Terminator'],
      ['?movieId', 'movie/director', '?directorId'],
      ['?directorId', 'person/name', '?directorName'],
    ],
    exampleTriples,
    {},
  ),
).toEqual([
  { '?movieId': 200, '?directorId': 100, '?directorName': 'James Cameron' },
]);
```

## Code

This too, is not so difficult. Here’s queryWhere:

```javascript
function queryWhere(patterns, db) {
  return patterns.reduce(
    (contexts, pattern) => {
      return contexts.flatMap((context) => querySingle(pattern, db, context));
    },
    [{}],
  );
}
```

We start off with one empty context. We then go pattern by pattern; for each pattern, we find all the successful contexts. We then take those contexts, and use them for the next pattern. By the end, we’ll have all the expanded contexts, and `queryWhere` works like a charm too!

# Query

## Goal

And now we’ve just about built ourselves the whole query engine! Next let’s handle `where` and `find`.

This could be the test we can play with:

```javascript
expect(
  query(
    {
      find: ['?directorName'],
      where: [
        ['?movieId', 'movie/title', 'The Terminator'],
        ['?movieId', 'movie/director', '?directorId'],
        ['?directorId', 'person/name', '?directorName'],
      ],
    },
    exampleTriples,
  ),
).toEqual([['James Cameron']]);
```

## Code

Here’s `query`:

```javascript
function query({ find, where }, db) {
  const contexts = queryWhere(where, db);
  return contexts.map((context) => actualize(context, find));
}
```

Our `queryWhere` returns all the successful contexts. We can then map those, and `actualize` our `find`:

```javascript
function actualize(context, find) {
  return find.map((findPart) => {
    return isVariable(findPart) ? context[findPart] : findPart;
  });
}
```

All `actualize` does is handle variables; if we see a variable in find, we just replace it with its bound value. [^2]

# Play

And voila! We have a query engine. Let’s see what we can do.

**When was Alien released?**

```javascript
query(
  {
    find: ['?year'],
    where: [
      ['?id', 'movie/title', 'Alien'],
      ['?id', 'movie/year', '?year'],
    ],
  },
  exampleTriples,
);
```

```javascript
[[1979]];
```

**What do I know about the entity with the id `200` ?**

```javascript
query(
  {
    find: ['?attr', '?value'],
    where: [[200, '?attr', '?value']],
  },
  exampleTriples,
);
```

```javascript
[
  ['movie/title', 'The Terminator'],
  ['movie/year', 1984],
  ['movie/director', 100],
  ['movie/cast', 101],
  ['movie/cast', 102],
  ['movie/cast', 103],
  ['movie/sequel', 207],
];
```

And, last by not least…

**Which directors shot Arnold for which movies?**

```javascript
query(
  {
    find: ['?directorName', '?movieTitle'],
    where: [
      ['?arnoldId', 'person/name', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger'],
      ['?movieId', 'movie/cast', '?arnoldId'],
      ['?movieId', 'movie/title', '?movieTitle'],
      ['?movieId', 'movie/director', '?directorId'],
      ['?directorId', 'person/name', '?directorName'],
    ],
  },
  exampleTriples,
);
```

🤯

```javascript
[
  ['James Cameron', 'The Terminator'],
  ['John McTiernan', 'Predator'],
  ['Mark L. Lester', 'Commando'],
  ['James Cameron', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'],
  ['Jonathan Mostow', 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'],
];
```

Now this is cool!

# Indexes

## Problem

Okay, but you may have already been thinking, “Our query engine will get slow”.

Let’s remember `querySingle`:

```javascript
function querySingle(pattern, db, context) {
  return db
    .map((triple) => matchPattern(pattern, triple, context))
    .filter((x) => x);
}
```

This is fine and dandy, but consider this query:

```javascript
querySingle([200, "movie/title", ?movieTitle], db, {})
```

We want to find the movie title for the entity with the id `200`. SQL would have used an index to quickly nab this for us.

But what about our query engine? It’ll have to search every single triple in our database!

## Goal

Let’s solve that. We shouldn’t need to search _every_ triple for a query like this; it’s time for indexes.

Here’s what we can do; Let’s create `entity`, `attribute`, and `value` indexes. Something like:

```javascript
{
  entityIndex: {
    200: [
      [200, "movie/title", "The Terminator"], [200, "movie/year", 1984],
      //...
    ],
    // ...
  },
  attrIndex: {
    "movie/title": [
      [200, "movie/title", "The Terminator"],
      [202, "movie/title", "Predator"],
      // ...
    ],
    // ...
  },
}
```

Now, if we had a pattern like this:

```javascript
[200, "movie/title", ?movieTitle]
```

We could be smart about how to get all the relevant triples: since `200` isn’t a variable, we could just use the `entityIndex`. We’d grab `entityIndex[200]` , and voila we’d have reduced our search to just 7 triples!

We can do more, but with this we’d already have a big win.

## createDB

Okay, let’s turn this into reality. We can start with a proper `db` object. We were just using `exampleTriples` before; now we’ll want to keep track of indexes too. Here’s what we can do:

```javascript
function createDB(triples) {
  return {
    triples,
    entityIndex: indexBy(triples, 0),
    attrIndex: indexBy(triples, 1),
    valueIndex: indexBy(triples, 2),
  };
}
```

We’ll take our triples, and start to index them.

## indexBy

And `indexBy` will handle that. It can just take the triples and create a mapping:

```javascript
function indexBy(triples, idx) {
  return triples.reduce((index, triple) => {
    const k = triple[idx];
    index[k] = index[k] || [];
    index[k].push(triple);
    return index;
  }, {});
}
```

Here `idx` represents the position in the triple; 0 would be `entity`, 1 would be `attribute`, 2 would be `value`.

## querySingle, updated

Now that we have indexes, we can use them in querySingle:

```javascript
export function querySingle(pattern, db, context) {
  return relevantTriples(pattern, db)
    .map((triple) => matchPattern(pattern, triple, context))
    .filter((x) => x);
}
```

The only change is `relevantTriples`. We’ll lean on it to figure out which index to use.

## relevantTriples

Here’s all relevantTriples does:

```javascript
function relevantTriples(pattern, db) {
  const [id, attribute, value] = pattern;
  if (!isVariable(id)) {
    return db.entityIndex[id];
  }
  if (!isVariable(attribute)) {
    return db.attrIndex[attribute];
  }
  if (!isVariable(value)) {
    return db.valueIndex[value];
  }
  return db.triples;
}
```

We take the pattern. We check the id, attribute, and the value. If _any_ of them aren’t variables, we can safely use the corresponding index.

With that, we’ve made our query engine faster 🙂

# Fin

I hope you had a blast making this and got a sense of how query engines work to boot. If you’d like to see the source in one place, [here it is](https://github.com/stopachka/datalogJS/blob/main/src/index.js).

## More

This is just the beginning. How about functions like “greater than” or “smaller than”? How about an “or” query? Let’s not forget aggregate functions. If you’re curious about this, I’d suggest three things:

First go through the [Learn Datalog](http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/) website; that’ll give you a full overview Datalog. Next, I’d suggest you go through the [SICP chapter on logic programming](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4). They go much further than this essay. Finally, you can look at Nikita Tonsky’s [datascript internals](https://tonsky.me/blog/datascript-internals/), for what a true production version could look like.

## Credits

Huge credit goes to SICP. When I completed their logic chapter, I realized that query languages didn't have to be so daunting. This essay is just a simplification of their chapter, translated into Javascript. The second credit needs to go to Nikita Tonsky’s essays. His [Datomic](https://tonsky.me/blog/unofficial-guide-to-datomic-internals/) and [Datascript](https://tonsky.me/blog/datascript-internals/) internals essays are a goldmine. Finally, I really enjoyed [Learn Datalog](http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/), and used their dataset for this essay.

_Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Irakli Safareli, Daniel Woelfel, Mark Shlick, Alex Reichert, Ian Sinnott, for reviewing drafts of this essay._
