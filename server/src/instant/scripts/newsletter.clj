  "Send newsletters to our users

  Usage: First run through these steps to prepare the email content
    1. Create email content in Dropbox. Get sign off on the copy.
    2. Export content as markdown and save to `www/intern/_emails/markdown/[slug].md`
    3. Preview the styled markdown at `localhost:3000/intern/emails/[slug]`
    4. Once preview looks good, you can generate images, html and text versions of the email
       from `client/Makefile` via `make build-email slug=[slug] `
       Notes:
        * We want both html and text to maximize delivery
        * We use pandoc to convert markdown to html. If you don't have it,
          you can install it via `brew install pandoc`
        * We extract dropbox paper image references from the markdown, save
          the images to 'client/www/public/img/emails/[slug]/', and replace
          dropbox paper image references with the new image paths
        * If need be, you can edit the ouputs in`client/www/_emails/html/[slug].html`
          and `client/www/_emails/txt/[slug].txt`
    5. Refresh the page at `localhost:3000/intern/emails/[slug]`
       and verify text version looks good via the text view button
    6. Once everything looks good open a PR with the changes. Make sure to
       merge the PR before sending the newsletter for images to work

    And now go through the comment block at the bottom of this file to send
    out the newsletter. Huzzah!
