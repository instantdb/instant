  "Listen to changes in Postgres.

   Background:

   When Postgres makes a change to the database, it first records the change into a
   Write-Ahead Log (WAL). This is useful for error recovery, and crucially,
   for replication.

   Postgres supports two kinds of replication: physical and logical.
   Physical Replication sends disk-level changes (think binary). Logical
   Replication sends data (think transactions)

   Logical Replication is very useful for us. If we subscribed to
   all logical changes in Postgres, we'd be able to keep InstaQL queries up to date.

   This namespace lets you create logical replication streams.
   This is done in three steps:
     1. Create a temporary replication slot. A replication slot is like a registration
        to the master database, saying 'I want to subscribe to you'.
     2. Create a special kind of PGConnection, configured for replication.
     3. Use pgjdbc's `replicationAPI` to start a stream."
